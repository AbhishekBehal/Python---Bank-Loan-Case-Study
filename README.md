# Python---Bank-Loan-Case-Study
Bank Loan Case Study
A. Handle Missing Data
●	Primary File: application_data.csv
○	This file will likely contain the majority of the data required for your analysis. Start by identifying and handling missing values in this dataset.
●	Reference File: columns_description.csv
○	If you're unsure about the significance of a column with missing values, refer to this file for a detailed description.
B. Identify Outliers
●	Primary File: application_data.csv
○	Focus on the numerical columns in this dataset to detect outliers. This file contains most of the applicant and loan details that will be crucial for this task.
C. Analyze Data Imbalance
●	Primary File: application_data.csv
○	The target variable indicating payment difficulties will be in this file. Use it to analyze any data imbalance in loan repayment scenarios.
D. Various Analyses
●	Primary File: application_data.csv
○	This file provides a comprehensive view of both the applicant and the loan, making it ideal for univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analyses.
●	Secondary File: previous_application.csv
○	For a deeper dive or more nuanced insights, especially when considering previous loan applications, this file can be invaluable.
E. Identify Correlations
●	Primary File: application_data.csv
○	Given that correlations will largely focus on the relationship between various attributes and the likelihood of default, this file will be the primary source of data.
When working through the tasks, always ensure that you understand the context and meaning of each column.
Tips and Tricks
●	Always back up your original data before making any changes.
●	While handling missing data, consider the business context. Sometimes, deleting the record might be more appropriate than imputation.
●	When identifying outliers, always cross-check with business knowledge. Some outliers might be genuine data points.
●	While analyzing correlations, remember that correlation does not imply causation. Use the insights to generate hypotheses and not conclusions.

Important Hypothesis:

1. Demographic Factors:
●	Gender & Payment Difficulty: Male clients might exhibit different payment behaviors than female clients.
●	Income & Payment Difficulty: Clients with lower total incomes might face more challenges in making timely payments.
●	Age & Payment Difficulty: Younger clients might face more payment difficulties than older clients.
2. Loan Characteristics:
●	Loan Amount & Payment Difficulty: Higher loan amounts might be associated with increased payment difficulties.
●	Loan Type & Payment Difficulty: Certain types of loans, like cash loans, might be associated with more payment difficulties than revolving loans.
●	Loan Term & Payment Difficulty: Short-term loans might see more initial payment difficulties than long-term loans.
3. Historical Data & Behavior:
●	Previous Applications & Payment Difficulty: Clients with multiple previous loan applications might have different payment behaviors than those with fewer applications.
●	Previous Loan Approval & Payment Difficulty: Clients who have had their previous loan applications approved might have different payment behaviors than those who were denied.
4. External Factors & Creditworthiness:
●	External Ratings & Payment Difficulty: Lower scores from external sources might correlate with increased payment difficulties.
5. Employment & Occupation:
●	Employment Duration & Payment Difficulty: Clients with shorter employment durations might face more payment difficulties.
●	Occupation Type & Payment Difficulty: Some occupation types might be associated with increased payment difficulties.
6. Application Details:
●	Application Timing & Payment Difficulty: Applications made during certain times, like weekends or late hours, might be associated with increased payment difficulties.
7. Property & Reality:
●	Property Ownership & Payment Difficulty: Clients who own real estate or a car might face different payment challenges than those who don't.
8. Family Status:
●	Family Size & Payment Difficulty: Clients with larger families (more children or dependents) might face more payment difficulties.
9. Regional Factors:
●	Client's Region & Payment Difficulty: Clients from certain regions or with specific regional ratings might exhibit different payment behaviors.
10. Previous Application Details (from previous_application.csv):
●	Previous Loan Purpose & Current Payment Difficulty: The purpose of previous loans might influence the likelihood of payment difficulties for the current loan. For instance, if a previous loan was for urgent medical needs, the client might face more financial strain.
11. Contract & Product Details (from previous_application.csv):
●	Previous Loan Contract Type & Current Payment Difficulty: The type of contract for previous loans (like cash loans, consumer loans) might influence current payment behaviors.
●	Interest Rates & Payment Difficulty: Clients with higher interest rates on their previous loans might face more payment difficulties.
12. Client Behavior (from previous_application.csv):
●	Previous Loan Cancellations & Current Payment Difficulty: Clients who have previously canceled loan applications might have different payment behaviors.
These hypotheses, rooted in the project's context, can guide the exploratory data analysis process. They can be validated or refuted using the datasets provided, which will offer insights into the factors influencing payment difficulties.
